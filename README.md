# why make this project tho?
i was in professional school and we had to do an assignement where we had to do a small web UI and i realized that it's a shit ton of lines of code just for the UI and i told myself "why not make it easier?" so i made this :D
---
# things in it:

- tabs system
- buttons
- toggles
- slider
- text label (insane)
- text input
- info things when hovering something with mouse
- all of it is customizable

docs are [here](https://github.com/4lpndev/4lpn-ui-lib/blob/main/DOCS.md)

~~# feel free to join the [discord](https://google.com)!~~ discord is everything but ready, once ready i'll make it redirect to the discord instead of google.

###### note: project is far from finished so there might be a lot of bugs
